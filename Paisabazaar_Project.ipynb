        "The financial sector relies heavily on accurate risk assessment to ensure that loans and credit are issued responsibly. As digital lending platforms like Paisabazaar expand, the challenge of evaluating customer creditworthiness has become increasingly critical. One of the key indicators of financial health is the credit score, which reflects a customer’s ability to manage debt, repay loans on time, and maintain financial stability. This project focuses on performing an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a large dataset of customers to understand the factors that influence credit scores and identify patterns that can help improve loan approval decisions while reducing the risk of fraud or default.\n",
        "\n",
        "The dataset provided contains approximately 100,000 records with 28 features. These features include demographic attributes such as Age and Occupation, financial details like Annual Income, Monthly Inhand Salary, and Number of Loans, and behavioral indicators such as Credit Utilization Ratio, Outstanding Debt, and Delayed Payments. The target variable is the Credit Score, classified into three categories: Good, Standard, and Poor. To prepare the data for analysis, irrelevant identifier fields such as ID, Name, SSN, and Customer_ID were removed. In addition, placeholder values such as \"No Data\" in the loan type column were treated as missing values. Fortunately, the dataset did not contain significant null values, making preprocessing relatively straightforward.\n",
        "\n",
        "The primary objective of this analysis was to uncover meaningful insights about the relationship between customer attributes and credit scores. Several visual and statistical techniques were applied to achieve this. First, the distribution of credit scores revealed that the majority of customers fell under the Standard category, with more Poor scorers than Good. This highlights a potential financial risk, as a large portion of customers are either average or below-average in terms of credit health.\n",
        "\n",
        "Further analysis of age distribution showed that most customers were between 20 and 45 years old, with relatively fewer older clients. This suggests that credit risk is concentrated in younger to middle-aged groups, who are often in the process of building or stabilizing their financial lives.\n",
        "\n",
        "The relationship between annual income and credit score revealed a clear trend: individuals with higher incomes were more likely to have Good credit scores, while those with lower incomes were disproportionately represented in the Poor category. This finding emphasizes the importance of income stability in maintaining financial credibility.\n",
        "\n",
        "A correlation heatmap provided deeper insights into how numeric features interact. Strong positive correlations were observed among income, salary, and monthly balance, while negative associations emerged between credit score and high credit utilization, outstanding debt, and delayed payments. These indicators are particularly important for lenders, as they directly reflect repayment behavior and financial discipline.\n",
        "\n",
        "Finally, the occupation versus credit score analysis highlighted profession-based trends. Stable and high-paying professions such as Engineers, Lawyers, and Doctors were more likely to have Good credit scores. In contrast, individuals in less stable or irregular-income professions, including Writers, Musicians, and Mechanics, tended toward Standard or Poor scores.\n",
        "\n",
        "In conclusion, this project demonstrates how exploratory data analysis can uncover valuable insights into customer behavior and credit health. The findings suggest that income stability, repayment discipline, and credit utilization are the most significant factors influencing credit scores. By leveraging these insights, Paisabazaar can refine its credit evaluation processes, reduce fraud risks, and provide tailored financial solutions to customers. This project not only highlights the importance of data-driven decision-making in financial services but also lays the groundwork for predictive modeling in future phases."
